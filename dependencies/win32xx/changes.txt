Version 8.7.0
=============

This version adds print preview support to the framework, and support for
Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019. 

Bug Fix
-------
* Corrected a possible access violation in debug mode when an application with
  a ribbon is closed.


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CPrintPreview.
  The CPrintPreview displays a preview of the print job before it is sent to
  the printer.

  To use CPrintPreview, do the following:
  1) Declare CPrintPreview as CMainFrame's member, specifying the source's
     class as the template type. The source is where the PrintPage function
     resides.
  2) Use SetSource to specify to where to call the PrintPage function.
  3) Declare a PrintPage function in the source for printing and previewing:
      void  PrintPage(CDC& dc, UINT page);
  4) Call CPrintPreview's DoPrintPreview(HWND ownerWindow, UINT maxPage = 1)
     to initiate the print preview.
  5) Create the preview window, and swap it into the frame's view.
  6) Handle the UWM_PREVIEWCLOSE message to swap back to the default view when
     the preview closes.

  CPrintPreview supports all print jobs. Any printing using the PrintPage 
  function can be previewed. Refer to the following samples:
   Frame; INIFrame; FastGDI; Notepad; PrintPreview; and Scribble.

* Added CHGlobal class.
  The CHGlobal class is a wrapper for a global memory handle. It automatically
  frees the global memory when it goes out of scope.

* Extended the CGlobalLock class.
  The CGlobalLock class is used to automatically lock and unlock global memory.
  This can be useful when working with printers. Global memory is used to hold
  memory for DEVNAMES and DEVMODE structures.

  When the global memory is locked, we acquire a pointer we can use to access
  its contents. CDevMode and CDevNames are useful typedefs for CGlobalLock.
  The global memory is locked when CGlobalLock is constructed, and unlocked
  when CGlobalLock is destructed.

* Extended CScrollView
  CScrollView now processes the following keys:
  - Home and End.
  - Page Up and Page Down.
  - Left, right, up, and down arrow keys.

* The samples now demonstrate an improved implementation of the Doc/View
  architecture. Previously CDoc and CView were both member variables of
  CMainFrame. Now CView is a member variable of CMainFrame, and CDoc is 
  a member variable of CView. This allows both CMainFrame and CView to
  easily access CDoc, which is what we need.

Version 8.6
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* m_hWnd is no longer a protected member variable of CWnd. Use either *this or
  GetHwnd() to access the window handle association associated with the CWnd.
  Eliminating protected member variables keeps the code robust, and is
  consistent with good software design.
   
* The programming style has been updated, and the Hungarian notation has 
  been removed. The m_ prefix for member variables has been retained, as 
  has a p prefix for pointers.
  
* Windows API functions that have been flagged as deprecated by Microsoft
  because of security issues have been replaced by their more modern equivalents
  for the compilers that support them. Warnings relating to deprecated code are
  no longer disabled by the library. If your code issues warnings related to 
  deprecated code, you can disable them, but updating your code might be a
  better option.
  
* Three new functions have been supplied to guard against buffer overruns when
  copying strings. They allow the size of the destination buffer to be specified, 
  much like strcpy_s and wcscpy_s. The new functions are:
  StrCopyA    Copies a char string to a buffer of specified size.
  StrCopyW    Copies a wide string to a buffer of specified size.
  StrCopy     Copies a TCHAR string to a buffer of specified size.
  
* Added CEvent
* Added CMutex
* Added CSemaphore
* Updated CSocket
 - now also supports async sockets
 - added NetClientAsync sample
 - added NetServerAsync sample
* Updated frames
 - Additional toolbars have better support for disabled buttons.
 - Optimised the creation of the image list for disabled menu icons.
 - Optimised AddMenuIcon (the disabled image-list isn't recreated unnecessarily).
 - Added UseStatusBar option for OnCreate.
 - Relaxed restrictions on size of images for menu icons. This provides better 
    support for larger screen scaling available on windows 10 for DPI aware apps.
 - Added VK_INSERT to the set of keys checked by the keyboard hook.

* Updated CImageList
* CRichEdit now supports RichEdit version 4.1 if available (XP and above).
* The Notepad sample now supports UTF-8.
* Added 5 new CResizer alignments for controls. They can be aligned as follows:
  - topleft:      Positions top left
  - topright:     Positions top right
  - bottomleft:   Positions bottom left
  - bottomright:  Positions bottom right
  - center:       Positions proportionally
  - leftcenter:   Positions proportionally along the left side
  - rightcenter:  Positions proportionally along the right side
  - topcenter:    Positions proportionally along the top side
  - bottomcenter: Positions proportionally along the bottom side

Version 8.5
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CFileFind class
  The CFileFind provides a means of finding one or more files that match
  a search string. Information can be extracted from each file found.
  
* Added CFolderDialog class

* Updated the status bar
  - A gripper is added if the parent window has the WS_THICKFRAME style.

* Updated docking frames
  - A CDockContainer can now be used as the view window for docking frames 
    (inherited from CDockFrame for example). This container can have zero
    or more tabs. The DockContainer sample now uses a CDockContainer as the
    frame's view window.

* Updated frames

Version 8.4
===========

This version of Win32++ introduces class templates to provide the different
types of frames. Frames can support a Single Document Interface (SDI) or a
Multiple Document Interface (MDI). They might or might not support docking,
and they might or might not support the Ribbon Framework. Each of these
optional features are provided using class templates.


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CFrameT class template
   - CFrame now inherits from CFrameT<CWnd>.
   - CDockFrame now inherits from CFrameT<CDocker>.
   To use these classes, inherit your CMainFrame from either CFrame or 
   CDockFrame as before.

* Added CMDIFrameT class template
   - CMDIFrame now inherits from CMDIFrameT<CFrame>
   - CMDIDockFrame now inherits from CMDIFrameT<CDockFrame>
   To use these classes, inherit your CMainFrame from either CMDIFrame
   or CMDIDockFrame as before.
   
* Added CRibbonFrameT class template.
   This class template adds a ribbon to any frame.
   - CRibbonFrame inherits from CRibbonFrameT<CFrame>
   - CRibbonDockFrame inherits from CRibbonFrameT<CDockFrame>
   - CRibbonMDIFrame inherits from CRibbonFrameT<CMDIFrame>
   - CRibbonMDIDockFrame inherits from CRibbonFrameT<CMDIDockFrame>
   To use these class, inherit your CMainFrame from either CRibbonFrame, 
   CRibbonDockFrame, CRibbonMDIFrame or CRibbonMDIDockFrame.
   Notes:
    1) To compile code using the Ribbon Framework you will need a Microsoft
       compiler. Visual Studio Community 2013 (or later) is recommended, but
       older Microsoft compilers can be used with the Windows 7 SDK.
    2) The Ribbon Framework only runs on Windows 7 or later operating systems.
       If the code is run on an earlier operating system, it reverts back to a
       menu and toolbar.
       
* Added CScrollView
  The CScrollView class adds scrolling to a CWnd used as a view window. To
  use this class, inherit the View window from CScrollView and use the
  SetScrollSizes function to enable scrolling. No change needs to be made
  to the code in OnDraw to allow it to be scrolled. CScrollView is used in
  the FastGDI and Picture samples.  
    
* The CMetaFile and CEnhMetaFile classes have been added to the framework.
 - CMetaFile wraps a HMETAFILE. CMetaFile can be used anywhere a HMETAFILE can
   be used. CMetatFile objects are reference counted, so they can be safely
   copied and returned from functions. CMetatFile automatically deletes
   the HMETAFILE when the last copy of the CMetaFile object goes out of scope.
   The CMetaFileDC::Close function returns a CMetaFile object.
   
 - CEnhMetaFile wraps a HENHMETAFILE. CEnhMetaFile can be used anywhere a
   HENHMETAFILE can be used. CEnhMetaFile objects are reference counted, 
   so they can be safely copied and returned from functions. CEnhMetaFile
   automatically deletes the HENHMETAFILE when the last copy of the 
   CEnhMetaFile object goes out of scope. The CMetaFileDC::CloseEnhanced
   function returns a CEnhMetaFile object.
   
* Renamed the text conversion typedefs. 
   This allows Win32++ to be used with ATL.
   
* Added the following samples.
 1) Animation sample.
   This sample demonstrates how to use an animation control in a dialog.
    
 2) ContextHelp sample.
   Displays help topics from a chm file. The help topics are chosen based on
   the current mouse position.
   
 3) MetaFile sample.
   This sample demonstrates how to create and display an enhanced metafile.
   
 4) RibbonMDIFrame sample.
   This sample demonstrates how to use the Window 7 ribbon with a MDI frame.    
   
 5) ScrollTextFile sample.
   This sample displays the contents of a text file in a scrollable window.   
   
 6) ToolTips sample.
   This sample demonstrates how to add tooltips to controls in a modal dialog.
   
* Improved the PrintPreview sample. It now accurately renders the preview, 
   irrespective of the font and paper size.

Version 8.3
===========

Bug Fixes:
 - Sometimes the view window of an undocked docker wasn't resized.
 - CFileDialog::GetPathName failed on Win98.
 - A dock ancestor didn't support docking unless it was also a top level window.
 - Dockers can now be used as a view window for a tab in CTab and CTabbedMDI.
 - An exception could be thrown when CTab was destroyed.
 - The highlighted menu radio box was out of position on Windows XP and older.
 - The Scribble sample destroyed a pen while it was selected in the device context.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added PrintPreview sample
   This sample extends the NotePad sample by adding support for Print Preview.
   The techniques demonstrated here can be used in your own applications to 
   provide a print preview.
   
* Added CRibbonDockFrame.
   This class adds docking to a frame window which supports the Ribbon UI.
   A RibbonDockFrame sample has been added to demonstrate CRibbonDockFrame.

* Updated CString
 - CString and the text conversion classes can now be used independently of
   the rest of the framework.
 - Added CString::Assign. This function is used to assign a specified number 
   of characters to a CString. The assigned string can contain NULL characters.    

* Updated CFrame and CMDIFrame
 - SetView can now be used to switch between multiple views for frames
   and MDI children.
 - Added a virtual SetupMenuIcons function. This functions adds the set of
   ToolBar images to the icons used in menus. Override this to add additional
   icons to the menus.
 - Updated MRU support.
   The display of long file names in the MRU uses the same approach as Visual 
   Studio.
 - Modified default theme colors for Windows 8 and Windows 10.
   
* Updated CDocker
  - SetView can now be used to switch between multiple views for CDocker and
    CDockContainer.  
  - Improved the way the active docker is determined. This is now implemented
    without a timer.
  
* Updated CDC
  - Additional overrides for CDC::SelectObject to allow this function to be used 
    without casting. For example:
      CPen Pen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(255, 0, 0));
      CPen OldPen = dcMem.SelectObject(pen);
  - GDI resources created by CDC are managed better. Old GDI resources are now
    destroyed immediately, rather than when the CDC is de-constructed.

* Updated CPropertyPage
  - OnApply, OnSetActive OnWizardBack, OnWizardFinish and OnWizardNext now return
    a BOOL, making them simpler to use.
  

Version 8.2
===========

New Features and Enhancements
----------------------------- 
* Added support for Common Dialogs
The following common dialogs have been added to the framework:
 - CColorDialog
 - CFindReplacDialog
 - CFileDialog
 - CFontDialog
 - CPrintDialog
 - CPageSetupDialog
 
The CPrintDialog and CPageSetupDialog classes share global memory for 
their hDevMode and hDevNames handles. This global memory persists after
the CPrintDialog and CPageSetupDialog objects are destructed, and is 
managed by CWinApp. There is no need for the user to manually lock,
unlock or free the hDevMode and hDevNames memory.
Note: CFile::OpenFileDialog and CFile::SaveFileDialog have been removed.
Use CFiledDialog for these instead.

* Updated CFrame
 - GetInitValues and SetInitValues have been added to conveniently store
   and retrieve a set of values from the registry or an INI file. These 
   functions replace a set of functions that stored and retrieved these
   values individually.

* Added GetAppDataPath
 - This function returns the path to the AppData folder. Applications 
   can create folders within AppData to store their data. 
   
* Updated samples
 - The INIFrame sample now stores the settings file in the AppData folder.
   It is important for applications to store values in the AppData folder
   on the more modern operating systems (Vista and above) as these don't
   allow the user to write to the "Program Files" folder.
   
* "New Projects" folder
 - This folder has been relocated to the samples folder. It is now more 
   convenient to use this as the starting point for your new projects.
   
* Added messages to retrieve the CWnd pointer. SendMessage can now be used
  to retrieve the window's CWnd pointer as an alternative to GetCWndPtr.
 - UWM_GETCWND returns the CWnd*
 - UWM_GETCFRAME returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CFrame
 - UWM_GETCDOCKER returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CDocker
 - UWM_GETCDOCKCONTAINER returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CDockContainer
 - UWM_GETCTABBEDMDI returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CTabbedMDI
 - UWM_GETCTOOLBAR returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CToolBar


Version 8.1
===========

New Features and Enhancements
----------------------------- 
* Added DDX/DDV
  CDataExchange provides support for Dialog Data eXchange(DDX) and Dialog Data 
  Validation(DDV). The CDataExchange class has a set of DDX and DDV member
  functions which perform the data exchange and validation for different types
  of controls. Typically this is used for controls in dialogs, but controls in
  any window support DDX and DDV.
  
  To use CDataExchange, perform the following steps:
   - Override DoDataExchange and specify the appropriate DDX and DDV functions.
   - Call UpdateData(FALSE) to initialize the controls and assign their values.
     This is typically done in the dialog's OnInitDialog function.
   - Call UpdateData(TRUE) to validate and retrieve the control data.   

  Refer to the DDXDemo sample for a demonstration of how to use CDataExchange

* Extended CString
   CString is now based on the CStringT template.
   CStringA is defined as CStringT<CHAR>. It is an ANSI only version of CString
   CStringW is defined as CStringT<WCHAR>. It is a UNICODE only version of CString.
   CString inherits from CStringT<TCHAR>. In addition to accepting TCHAR when 
   constructed, it also accepts CHAR and WCHAR. It is backwards compatible with
   the previous implementation of CString.
   Additional features added to CStringA, CStringW and CString:   
   - Added operator + support for ints and doubles.
   - Added operator += support for ints and doubles.
   - Added operator = support for ints and doubles.
   
* Updated CArchive
   - Added the ability to archive char and wchar character arrays. The abilty
     to archive TCHAR character arrays is retained.
   - Added the ability to archive CStringA and CStringW. The ability to
     archive CString is retained.      
   
* Added CDockFrame.
   Inherit your CMainFrame from CDockFrame to add docking capabilities to normal
   Single Document Interface (SDI) frames. Frames which don't require docking 
   capabilities should inherit from CFrame. The use of CFrame instead of
   CDockFrame results in as smaller executable file size.
   Refer to the Dock, DockContainer, DockTabbeedMDI and Splitter samples for
   a demonstration of CDockFrame.

* Added CMDIDockFrame
   Inherit your CMainMDIFrame from CMDIDockFrame to add docking capabilities to
   Multiple Document Interface (MDI) frames. MDI Frames which don't require docking
   capabilities should inherit from CMDIFrame. The use of CMDIFrame instead of
   CMDIDockFrame results in a smaller executable file size.
   Refer to the DockMDI sample for a demonstration of CMDIDockFrame.
   
* Updated the exception handling
   - Added CException             ( inherits from std::exception )
   - Added CFileException         ( inherits from CException ) 
   - Added CNotSupportedException ( inherits from CException )
   - Added CUserException         ( inherits from CException )
   - Updated CWinException        ( inherits from CException )
      
* Updated CWnd
   - Added OnPaint virtual function. OnPaint calls OnDraw for generic windows,
     but not for window controls. Users can now override OnPaint to draw to
     window controls as an alternative to custom draw or owner draw.     
   - Added DoDataExchange and UpdatedData to support CDataExchange.     
   
* Updated the documentation
   - Added 'Dialog Data Exchange (DDX and DDV)  to Using Win32++
   - Added 'Doc View Model'                     to Using Win32++
   - Added 'Serialization with CArchive'        to Using Win32++
   - Extended 'CString'                         in Using Win32++   


Version 8.0.1
==============

New Features and Enhancements
----------------------------- 
* Win32++ is now system DPI (Dots Per Inch) aware.
  The manifest for each sample has been updated to support DPI aware.
  The size of the CFrame status bar and menu elements are now adjusted to
  accommodate the system's DPI settings. 
  
  Users may wish to detect the current DPI and their GUI layout accordingly
  to support different DPIs. Refer to:
  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn469266%28v=vs.85%29.aspx


Version 8.0
===========

New Features and Enhancements
----------------------------- 
* Added CArchive.
  CArchive provides a convenient means of saving and restoring an application's
  data, by streaming the data to and from a file.
  
* Added CObject
  CObject provides the Serialize virtual function which is used by CArchive. 
  Any class inherited from CObject can override Serialize to customize the
  way its data is saved in the archive. CWnd and CWinThread inherit from
  CObject. Classes created by the user can inherit from CObject as well.  
  
* Added CRegKey.
  CRegKey is a wrapper for functions used to access and modify the registry.  

* Added CTime and CTimeSpan
  CTime manages the display of date and time.
  CTimeSpan calculates the interval between times and dates.

* Added  GetCommandLineArgs
  This function provides access to the command line arguments. They are
  returned in a vector of CString.

* Added VERIFY macro
  In debug mode, VERIFY asserts if the expression evaluates to zero
  In release mode, VERIFY evaluates the expression, but doesn't assert
  
* Renamed Header files
  The header files located in the include directory have been prefixed 
  with wxx_ . This was done to avoid potential name conflicts with header
  files from other libraries.  

* Updated CFile
  - The nOpenFlags used in CFile::Open, and CFile's constructor continue to
    support the same file creation modes as before, but now support additional
    modes as well.
    Possible nOpenFlag values: CREATE_NEW, CREATE_ALWAYS, OPEN_EXISTING, 
        OPEN_ALWAYS, TRUNCATE_EXISTING
     Default value: OPEN_EXISTING | modeReadWrite
     The following modes are also supported:
    - CFile::modeCreate         Same as CREATE_ALWAYS.
    - CFile::modeNoTruncate     Same as OPEN_ALWAYS.
    - CFile::modeRead           Requests read access only.
    - CFile::modeWrite          Requests write access only.
    - CFile::modeReadWrite      Requests read and write access.
    - CFile::shareExclusive     Denies read and write access to all others.
    - CFile::shareDenyWrite     Denies write access to all others.
    - CFile::shareDenyRead      Denies read access to all others.
    - CFile::shareDenyNone      No sharing restrictions.
    - CFile now throws an exception under the following circumstances
    - Failure to read from a file.
    - Failure to write to a file.
    - Failure to open the file in CFile's constructor.
    

Version 7.9
===========

Overview
--------
This version of Win32++ moves away from the use of pointers. Where before we 
would use pointers to objects in Win32++ function calls, we now use the objects
directly. The USE_OBSOLETE_CODE macro has been provided in this version to make
code migration easier. Even with this macro defined, you will need to use 
non-pointer arguments in Win32++ function calls.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* The FromHandle method of creating temporary CWnds has been obsoleted. 
The FromHandle approach has been replaced. CWnd member functions which 
previously returned a CWnd pointer(CWnd*) now return CWnd. 
Coding examples: (The GetParent function now returns a CWnd)
 GetParent().SendMessage(SomeMessage, wParam, lParam);
 HWND hWnd = GetParent(); // retrieve the parent window's HWND
 
* The FromHandle for the other types has been obsoleted as well. This includes:
  - CBitmap::FromHandle
  - CBrush::FromHandle
  - CDC::FromHandle
  - CFont::FromHandle
  - CPalette:: FromHandle
  - CPen::FromHandle
  - CRgn::FromHandle
 
* Many functions which previously used a CWnd* argument now use a HWND
argument. This has the following advantages:
 - These functions can be used directly for a HWND, CWnd or CWnd pointer.
 - We no longer have to needlessly create temporary CWnds.
Coding examples: (the Create function now has a HWND argument)
 CWnd MyCWnd;
 MyCWnd.Create(Some_CWnd);   // Another CWnd called Some_CWnd is the parent window 
 MyCWnd.Create(*this);       // This CWnd is the parent window. (dereferenced pointer)
 MyCWnd.Create(GetHwnd());   // This CWnd is the parent window.
 MyCwnd.Create(GetParent()); // The parent of this CWnd is the parent window
 MyCWnd.Create(Some_HWND);   // A window with the specified HWND is the parent window 
 MyCWnd.Create();            // The created window has no parent window
 
 Note: CWnd has operator overloading. We can use the CWnd object in place
 of its corresponding HWND anywhere in code.  

* Many functions which previously used pointers to other Win32++ classes
now also use the relevant handle instead. These include member functions for
CDC, CBitmap, CBrush, CFont, CPalette, CPen, CRgn, CImageList and CMenu.
Each of these classes have operator overloading, so the class object can be
used instead of the handle.

* CDC, CBrush, CBitmap, CFont, CPalette, CPen, CRgn, CMenu and CImageList.
 - These classes destroy the resource they manage when their destructor is
   called, but only if Win32++ created it. This allows us to attach resources
   provided by the operating system (HDCs, HFONTS, HIMAGELISTS etc.) without
   having to detach them later to prevent them from being destroyed.
 - These classes can be re-used. There is no need to detach the current
   handle before assigning a new one.
 - These classes use reference counting, so they can be safely copied. This
   allows them to be returned by value from functions.
   

Version 7.8
===========

New Features and enhancements
-----------------------------
* Updated CDC
   - Added palette support.
   - Added path support.
   - Added MaskBlt and TransparentBlt functions
   - Now able to retrieve GDI objects currently selected in the device context.

Version 7.7
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Frames now directly support docking
   Previously CFrames implemented docking through the view window. Now CFrame 
   inherits from CDocker and implements docking directly. Users can now add
   dockers to a frame that doesn't use a docker as the view window. 
   Alternatively users can implement docking through the view window as before.   

* MDI Frames directly support docking
   Dockers can now be added to classic MDI Frames. Code to add dockers to a
   MDI frame might look like this:
   
    void CMainMDIFrame::OnInitialUpdate()
    {
        // Add some dockers
        DWORD dwStyle = DS_CLIENTEDGE; // The style added to each docker
        int DockWidth = 150;
        AddDockedChild(new CDockFiles, DS_DOCKED_LEFT | dwStyle, DockWidth);
        AddDockedChild(new CDockFiles, DS_DOCKED_RIGHT | dwStyle, DockWidth);
        
        // Add some MDI children
        AddMDIChild(new CSimpleMDIChild);
        AddMDIChild(new CSimpleMDIChild);       
    }
    
* Windows created by CWnd::Create can now be initially created as maximized or
   minimized by specifying the WS_MAXIMIZE or WS_MINIMIZE styles in PreCreate,
   even though this is not supported by the CreateWindowEx Windows API function.
   
* Frames now load the save state (maximized or normal) from the registry.   
    
* Added DockMDI sample. 
  This sample demonstrates adding Dockers to MDI Frames.
    
* Dockers now default to fixed size resizing instead of proportional size 
   resizing for dock children. The DS_FIXED_RESIZE style has been replaced with
   DS_NO_FIXED_RESIZE.  
    

Version 7.6
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added StatusBar themes.
   StatusBars can fill the background with a color gradient. The two 
   colors can be specified by SetStatusBarTheme.
   
* Switching between views is now supported, using SetView
  The following classes support switching views:
   - Frames
   - MDI Children
   - Dockers
   - DockContainers
   
* Updated Frames
   - IDW_INDICATOR_CAPS, IDW_INDICATOR_NUM and IDW_INDICATOR_SCRL string
      resources are used to define the status indicators. These string
      resources should be added to the resource script (resource.rc). Refer
      to resource.rc in the frame sample for an example.
   
* Updated Dockers
   - Dock targets invalidated by DS_NO_DOCKCHILD_XXXX are hidden or greyed.
   - Click and drag tab swaps to swap them for DockContainers and TabbedMDIs.
   - Parent dockers have a minimum size.
   - Added support for DS_FIXED_RESIZE. Normally dock children are resized 
      proportionally, but with this style the size of dock children is fixed.
   - Dock containers with a single tab can hide the tab.
   - Improved hinting for container within container docking.
 
* Added support for vertical ToolBars and ReBars
   - Vertical ToolBars and ReBars can be themed by CFrame. These are 
      demonstrated in the ReBar and ToolBar samples. 
   
* Updated the samples
   - Added DateTime sample to demonstrate CDateTime and CMonthCalendar. 
   - Added ToolBar sample. It demonstrates customizing ToolBars by dynamically
      adding or removing ToolBar buttons. It also demonstrates an additional
      ToolBar which can be positioned at the top, bottom, left or right of the
      view window.
   - Added ReBar sample. It demonstrates an additional ReBar which contains 
      a ToolBar and can be positioned at the top, bottom, left or right of the
      view window.
   - Added StatusBar sample. It demonstrates a colored StatusBar with a
      hyperlink, a progress bar, an icon and an owner drawn part.     
   - A window menu has been added to the DockTabbedMDI sample.
   - The Themes sample demonstrates how to save a rebar's band sizes and 
      positions in the registry.
   - The Themes sample demonstrates StatusBar themes.
   - The Dock sample demonstrates various dock styles including:
     - Proportional Resize
     - 3D Border
     - Disable Undocking
     - Disable Resizing
     - Disable Dock closing
     - Disable docking on the left or right
     

Version 7.5
===========
Bug Fixes:
* The drop-down lists for combo boxes are now displayed correctly.
* Fix for ToolBars on Win95

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CRichEdit. This class provides support for Rich Edit controls
* Updated the approach to using threads
   - CWinThread is used in place of CThread.
   - CWinApp now inherits from CWinThread.
   - GUI threads are now implemented without multiple inheritance. Refer to
     the Threads and DirectX samples for an example of how to create GUI
     threads.
   - CWinThread provides a constructor to facilitate worker threads. This 
     constructor allows users to specify the thread's callback function and
     a LPVOID pParams parameter.
   - The thread is now created using the CreateThread member function rather
     than being automatically created in the constructor. This provides more
     control over if and when the thread is created.
* Updated CWinApp
   - CWinApp now inherits from CWinThread. Some member functions were moved
     from CWinApp to CWinThread.
   - Added wrapper functions for loading and setting the cursor, and loading 
     icons.    
* Updated CFrame
   - A keyboard hook is used to retrieve keyboard indicators (NUM, CAPS, SCRL),
     removing the need for a timer. 
   - If the co-ordinates retrieved from registry would place the frame off
     screen, the frame is repositioned.
   - Added GetTitle, SetTitle, GetStatusText and SetStatusText functions.     
* Updated CDocker and CTab
   - CTabs and CDockers now support the WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL extended style. This
     style creates a window whose horizontal origin is on the right edge to 
     better suite Arabic and Hebrew languages.
* Updated CDialog
   - Added support for OnIdle in modal dialogs. Modeless dialogs already have
     OnIdle support.     


Version 7.4
===========
     
New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CImageList. CImageList manages a collection of images (Image List).
* Added ToolBarDemo Sample. 
   - demonstrates ToolBar customization.
   - demonstrates adding and removing ToolBar buttons.
   - demonstrates saving and restoring ToolBar layout.
   - demonstrates changing the ToolBar's image list.
* Updated CWnd:
   - Modified OnCreate. It now provides a LPCREATSTRUCT. Any function overriding
      OnCreate will need to be modified too. 
   - Added OnAttach. It is called when a window is attached to a CWnd.
   - Added OnClose. It is called when a window asks to be closed (WM_CLOSE).
   - Added OnDestroy. It is called when a window is destroyed (WM_DESTROY).
   - CreateWindowEx now uses HMENU or UINT instead of CMenu*. This allows 
      the menu parameter to specify a menu for a parent window, or a window ID
      for a child window.   
* Updated CFrame:
   - Frames now use the IDW_READY resource for the "Ready" string.
   - CFrame no longer requires the number of images in the ToolBar bitmap to 
      equal the number of ToolBar buttons. The width of the button bitmap is
      now assumed to be equal to its height or a minimum of 16.
   - The code for ToolBar and MenuBar themes has been moved to CFrame, making it
      easier to customize. Also, the notifications (from WM_NOTIFY) are handled in
      virtual functions, making them easier to override.   
   - ToolBars for DockContainers automatically use the Frame's ToolBar theme.
   - We can now specify the index of the image in AddToolbarButton.
* Updated CFile:
   - CFile functions are now virtual.
   - OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog allow the dialog's title to be specified.
* Updated CToolBar
   - SetButtonInfo can now be used to change a ToolBar button's image and 
      command ID.
   - Functions now use CImageList* instead of HIMAGELIST
   - Added support for ToolBar customization.
   - AddButton now also allows us to specify the image's index.
* Updated CDialog
   - Added GetDefID, GotoDlgCtrl, MapDialogRect, NextDlgCtrl, PrevDlgCtrl
      and SetDefID.
   - The constructor no longer sets the dialog's parent. The parent of the dialog 
      (if any) is set when the dialog is created (with DoModal or DoModeless).  
* Updated CTab.
   - CTab now provides wrapper functions for all the Tab control macros.


Version 7.3
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Adjusted the frame's appearance
    - Updated the visual appearance of popup menus on systems using Windows Aero. On 
      systems with Aero, popup menus are rendered with Windows Visual Styles. Systems
      without Aero continue to use the Win32++ theme for popup menus.
    - Frames now honour the current window theme's menu and status fonts.
    - the frame's appearance changes dynamically to reflect changes to the window theme.
    - minor adjustment to the ReBar theme colours for the "Modern" theme.
* Added the following controls
   - CDateTime
   - CHeader
   - CHotKey
   - CIPAddress
   - CMonthCalendar
   - CTooltip

Version 7.2
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CString class
   The CString class is intended to provide much of the same functionality
   as the CString class provided with MFC/ATL.
* Added CMenu
   The CMenu class is intended to provide much of the same functionality
   as the CMenu class provided with MFC. The library now standardises on
   using pointers to CMenu, instead of HMENU.   
* Added CFile
   This class provides a convenient wrapper for functions dealing with files.
* Added Idle processing.
   The Idle processing is also available for use by users, and is used in much
   the same way as OnIdle processing in MFC.

Version 7.1
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added support for Task Dialogs
* Added the following set of GDI classes: CBitmap, CBrush, CFont, CPalette, 
   CPen and CRgn. These work in cooperation with the existing CDC class.
* Added a set of new Text conversion functions based on classes.
   The complete set of functions are:
    A2BSTR      ANSI  to BSTR
    A2OLE       ANSI  to OLE
    A2T         ANSI  to TCHAR
    A2W         ANSI  to WCHAR
    OLE2A       OLE   to ANSI
    OLE2T       OLE   to TCHAR
    OLE2W       OLE   to WCHAR
    T2A         TCHAR to ANSI
    T2BSTR      TCHAR to BSTR
    T2OLE       TCHAR to OLE
    T2W         TCHAR to Wide
    W2A         WCHAR to ANSI
    W2BSTR      WCHAR to BSTR
    W2OLE       WCHAR to OLE
    W2T         WCHAR to TCHAR
   Refer to the help documentation for instructions on using these functions.

Version 7.0
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CThread class to simplify the task of using threads and creating
   windows in different threads. CThread can be used for both worker threads
   and GUI threads. Refer to the Thread and DirectX samples for examples of 
   how to use CThread to create windows in a different thread. The DirectX
   sample also uses a customized message loop for the thread.   
* Added the following control wrappers: CAnimation, CComboBox, CComboBoxEx,
   CProgressBar, CScrollBar, CSlider, and CSpinButton.  
* Added support for re-sizable dialogs. The CResizer class has been added
   to dialog.h to facilitate dialog resizing. Refer to the forms sample for
   an example of how to put CResizer to use.
* Added IPv6 support to CSocket. The network samples have been updated to
   take advantage of IPv6 support. IP version 6 is supported on Vista 
   operating systems and newer.
* Added Shared_Ptr class. Note that a "shared_ptr" will be available for the
   updated C++ standard. It is already available with some modern compilers,
   and also for users of the Boost library. The "Shared_Ptr" class is intended
   as an alternative for those users who would like to use a "shared_ptr", but
   don't have access to one yet. Unlike auto-ptr's, shared_ptr's can be used
   to safely store pointers in vectors and other STL containers.
* Added the GDIPlus sample to demonstrate how to use the GDIPlus library 
   provided with modern Windows operating systems (XP and above).
* Win32++ can now be run from inside a DLL. The "DLL" sample demonstrates how to
   put a Win32++ dialog in a dll, and run it from a test program.  


Version 6.9
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added a WebBrowser class called CWebBrowser.  This class provides a web 
   browser in a window. This class can be used as a view window anywhere 
   view windows are used, such as in frames, dockers, MDI Children, 
   Tabbed MDIs etc.  It has no dependence on ATL, greatly simplifying the 
   approach to adding a browser window to any application.  It can be compiled
   by any of the supported compilers including Dev-C++, MinGW and the Borland 
   compilers as well as the compilers from Microsoft.  
* Added an ActiveX host class called CAXWindow.  
* Modified the Browser sample to use the new CWebBrowser class. It also 
   demonstrates how to use an event sink to get notification of browser events.
* Added a Tray sample which demonstrates how to create an application 
   which can be minimised to the system tray, and restored.  


Version 6.8
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Support has been added for the Windows Ribbon Framework available on 
   Windows 7 operating systems. The RibbonFrame and RibbonSimple samples 
   demonstrates how to implement the ribbon. RibbonFrame reverts back to 
   using the traditional Toolbar and Menubar if the operating system doesn't
   support the ribbon framework.  
* Helper classes have been added for the standard controls, namely the Button,
   Edit, Listbox, and Static controls.
* Dockers can now be hidden and unhidden. Refer to the Splitter sample for a
   demonstration of this feature.
* Modal dialogs now support pretranslated messages.          


Version 6.7
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* A set of tools is now provided in the tools folder. They include a set of 
   batch files for compiling the examples and batch files to "clean" them.
* Support has been added for Right to Left languages which include Hebrew and 
   Arabic. The CFrame and CDocker classes now honour the WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL 
   extended style used by these languages. To take advantage of this feature,
   use PreCreate to set this extended when using CFrame, CMDIFrame, CTab, 
   CTabbedMDI, and CDocker.  
* OnInitialUpdate is now called after Attach or AttachDlgItem.   


Version 6.6
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Enhancements to docking, containers and tabs.
  - By default the dockers are immediately resized while the splitter bar is 
     being dragged. To defer resizing until the splitter bar is released, use
     SetDragAutoResize(FALSE).
  - The close and list buttons now indicate when they are hot and pressed.
  - Added SetTabText, SetTabImage and SwapTabs to the CTab class.
  - Minor improvements to the painting of tabs, containers and dockers.
* Enhancements to GDI graphics support.
  - The CDC class has been extended. It now includes wrapper functions for 
     the Device Context related functions.
  - Added the CBitmapInfoPtr class. This simplifies the use of the BITMAPINFO
     structure in functions like GetDIBits and SetDIBits.
  - Added GrayScaleBitmap function to gdi.h. It converts a colored bitmap to
     to gray-scale.     
* Enhancements to frames
  - When a menu is about to be displayed, OnUpdateMenu is called to provide
     an opportunity to modify the check state of the menu items.
  - The style of the rebarband is now specified in AddToolbarBand. This 
     facilities saving and restoring ToolBar settings from the registry (as 
     demonstrated in the Themes example.)  
  - The Frame's ShowToolbar and ShowStatusbar states are now saved in the
     registry.  
   

Version 6.5
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Precompiled Headers
   Samples now demonstrates the use of Precompiled Headers. More experienced
   users might prefer this approach as it provides for much faster compile times.
* Added CTab class. 
   This class is used by CContainer and CTabbedMDI, and can also be used as a
   view window.
* Added TabDemo example.
   Refer to the TabDemo example for a demonstration of how CTab class is
   used as a view window in a frame. TabDialogDemo also uses CTab. 
* Added CTabbedMDI class.
   A TabbedMDI can be used as a view window for a Frame or a Dockable. As the 
   name suggests, it provides tabs for a MDI window. 
* Added TabbedMDI example within docking.
   Refer to the docking TabbedMDI example for a demonstration of how CTabbedMDI
   class is used.
   
   
Version 6.4
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Docking:
  - Added tabbed docking container with optional ToolBar
  - Added close button to the caption of docked windows
  - Added 'outer' docking  i.e. docking at the side of the frame rather 
      than inside another Docker.
  - Added a second docking example demonstrating containers
  - Added save/restore dock layout to docking examples
  - Added Close All Dockables and Default Dock Layout to docking examples
  - Added Win98 and WinME support for docking. 
* Added Region support to CDC class.
* Updated the Notepad sample to handle Unicode text.
* Themes example now demonstrates a ComboBoxEx control in its ToolBar  
 

Version 6.3
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added support for docking.
* Added the Fast GDI demo. This demonstrates the use of the TintBitmap function.
* MDI child windows now require a view window. The use of a view window is 
   now the same for Frames, MDI children, and dockables. The MDI demo example
   has been extended to include ListView and TreeView views.
* Added message translation. This allows modeless dialogs and propertysheets
   to process the tab (and other) keys.
* Added a CWnd::Destroy function. This returns a CWnd back to its default
   state ready to be reused.
* The Frame now stores which child window had focus before it is de-activated,
   and returns focus to this child when the frame application is reactivated.    
     

Version 6.2
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Frame applications now store the window size and position in the registry.
   To enable this, set the m_KeyName member variable in CMainFrame's 
   constructor. This member variable can be used to reflect the company name
   and application name, for example:  m_KeyName = _T("SomeCompany\\SomeApp");
* Frame applications now provide a Most Recently Used (MRU) list. This list is 
   stored in the registry.
* Extended CWnd
   CWnd now includes functions which wrap many of the Windows API functions
   that affect to windows. 


Version 6.1
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* All Win32++ code has been moved to header files.
   This simplifies the use of Win32++. To add Win32++ to a project, simply 
   include the appropriate Win32++ header files in your code. There is no
   longer any need to add the Win32++ files to the project, although doing so
   may still prove useful under some circumstances. Depending on the 
   compiler/IDE used, adding the Win32++ header files to the project may add
   the various Win32++ classes to the class view.
* Added CListView class.
   This class encapsulates the various messages and macros used by the Win32/64 
   API to manage the List-View common control. You can inherit from this class
   when creating your own List-View control in a window, or attaching a 
  List-View control from a dialog.
* Added CTreeView class.
   This class encapsulates the various messages and macros used by the 
   Win32/64 API to manage the Tree-View common control. You can inherit from
   this class when creating your own Tree-View control in a window, or 
   attaching a Tree-View control from a dialog.
* Added CPoint CRect and CSize classes
   The CPoint, CRect and CSize classes can be used anywhere a POINT, RECT
   or SIZE struct is used.
* Added support for x64 applications.
   Win32++ can now be used to build 64 bit applications. The manifest file has 
   been modified to support both 32bit and 64bit applications. The new manifest
   should be used for any 64 bit applications that use common controls. Users
   are encouraged to use the modern Win64 API functions like:
   GetWindowLongPtr, SetWindowLongPtr, GetClassLongPtr and SetClassLongPtr.
   Win32++ will convert these back to their Win32 API counterparts if required.
* 32 bit bitmaps are now supported for toolbars (requires XP or Vista)


Version 6.0
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Win32++ now also directly supports the Windows CE operating systems. 
   Windows CE is the operating system used on such things as Pocket PCs, 
   embedded systems and SmartPhones. The Win32++ examples for Windows CE
   include the project files for eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0, and Visual 
   Studio 2005. 
* Added Networking support. Win32++ now includes a CSocket class which
   encapsulates much of the Winsock API. This class is capable of monitoring
   network events, such as connection requests from clients, and notification
   that the socket has data ready to be received. Command line and dialog
   examples are provide to demonstrate how the class can be used to create
   TCP/IP (and UDP/IP) servers and clients.
* Added a CDC class. This class simplifies the drawing to device contexts. 
   This class can be used anywhere we would normally use a handle to a 
   device context (HDC). Its features include:
   - Automates the selection of GDI objects into the device context.
   - Automates the destruction of GDI objects.
   - Automates the deletion or release of the device contexts.
* PreRegisterClass can now be used to set the WNDCLASS parameters before the
   window class is registered. This provides a convenient way to set a window's
   background brush or cursor. 
  
Version 5.6
===========
* Property sheets are now supported. Property sheets can be modal, modeless
  or Wizards.

Version 5.5
===========
* Added Menubar theme support
  - Gradient background for hot buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for pressed buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient Sidebar for menu items based on pressed button colors.
  - A border color for Menubar buttons and selected menu items


Version 5.4
===========
* Added Rebar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for the rebar control (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for the rebar bands (any two colors)
  - The Menubar can be locked in place.
  - The bands can be kept left.
  - Short bands
  - Bands can have rounded borders
  - Bands with rounded borders can have a flat style
* Added Toolbar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for hot buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for pressed buttons (any two colors)
  - Colored outline for hot and pressed buttons (any color)
* CRebar provides built in support for multiple toolbars with AddToolbarBand

Version 5.3
===========
* Owner drawn drop down menu items with icons.  By default, the
   framework uses the ToolBar's bitmap and resource IDs for displaying 
   icons. Override CFrame::SetButtons to change this behavior.
* CreateEx automatically subclasses windows controls such as List-View, 
   ToolBar, Richedit etc.

   
Version 5.2
===========
* Added a separate HINSTANCE for resources. This provides for multilingual
   support, when resources are loaded via a DLL.

   
Version 5.1
===========
* Attach can be used to subclass existing windows and associate them with a CWnd.
* Dialog controls can be sublcassed and converted to CWnd objects, using 
   AttachDlgItem.
* Improvements to CToolbar. The ToolBar uses image lists which support using 
  separate bitmaps for normal, hot and disabled buttons. Text can be added
  to ToolBar buttons, and the style can be set.  
* Notifications from common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object that
  generated them. 
* Messages from old style common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object
  that generated them.
  

Version 5.0
===========
* Added rebars to the frame window
* Added a menubar to the frame window
* Added MDI frame support
* Added splitter window support


Version 4.0
===========
* Changed the method of associating the Window's handle (HWND) and 
   the CWnd pointer.  Previously SetWindowLong was used to store the 
   CWin pointer in the windows data area. Now std::map is used to 
   associate a CWnd pointer with the HWND (i.e. the window's handle).   
* Added the lpParam parameter to both versions of the CWnd::CreateEx
   function.  Users are now free to use lpParam for their own 
   purposes. This parameter defaults to NULL for backwards 
   compatibility.
        

Version 3.0
===========
* Added Tracing. To use tracing, ensure that you are in Debug mode, 
   i.e. the variable _DEBUG is defined, and use the TRACE("xxxxx")
   function to send trace messages.
* Enhanced the error reporting in the event of an exception. The 
   GetLastError information is now decoded and displayed if it 
   provides any additional information.
* Added support for multi-threaded applications.    
    

Version 2.0
===========
* The code is now Unicode compliant.
* Added CWinApp class to start Win32++.
* Added CDialog class to support modal and modeless dialogs as well
   as indirect dialogs (dialogs created from a dialog template in
   memory).
* Added the Create function to simplify window creation.
    

Version 1.0
===========
Initial Release
