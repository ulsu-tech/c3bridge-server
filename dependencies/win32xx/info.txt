CodeBlocks is an IDE. The project files are configured for the following 
compilers:
* Borland Compiler Version 5.5
* MinGW GNU compiler
* Visual C++ Toolkit 2003

Dev-C++ is an IDE which supports the MinGW GNU compiler

Supported Operating Systems
===========================
The programs compiled with Win32++ can run on the following operating systems:
* Win95 (all versions, with or without Internet Explorer 4 installed)
* Win98 (both versions)
* WinME
* Windows NT 4
* Windows 2000
* Windows XP
* Windows XP x64
* Windows Vista
* Windows Vista x64
* Windows 7
* Windows 7 x64
* Windows 8
* Windows 8 x 64
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 8.1 x 64
* Windows 10
* Windows 10 x 64
* Windows Server 2003
* Windows Server 2003 x64
* Windows Server 2008
* Windows Server 2008 x64
* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2016
* Windows CE

Note: Programs compiled with Visual Studio.net 2008 and Visual Studio.net 2008 
Express will not run on Win32 operating systems earlier than Windows 2000.

Win32++ is Unicode compliant and can therefore be used to develop Unicode
applications. Users are advised that older operating systems (namely Win95, 
Win98 and WinME) don't support Unicode applications.

Win32++ supports 64bit compilers, and can be used to develop 64bit code.

Directory Structure
===================
When extracting the files from the zip archive, be sure to preserve the 
directory structure. The directory structure will typically look like this:

.\help
.\include
.\output
.\samples
.\tools
.\tutorials
.\WCE samples

The files which form the Win32++ library are contained in the include
folder.
