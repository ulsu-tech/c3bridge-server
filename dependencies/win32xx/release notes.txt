About Win32++
-------------
Win32++ is simple and easy to understand framework for developing Win32 
applications using C++. It brings an object oriented approach to programming 
directly with the Win32 API. Each window created is a C++ class object capable 
of having its own window procedure for routing messages.

Getting Started
---------------
Each file download includes the project files for Dev-C++, CodeBlocks and the
various compilers from Microsoft. CodeBlocks is an IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) that supports GNU GCC, Borland Developer Studio 2006 and Microsoft
C++ Toolkit 2003.

You  can start with one of the sample programs, and add your code. Alternatively
you can start with the projects and sample code provided in the "new projects" 
folder. 

For additional information on getting started, refer to the help included
in the documentation.
